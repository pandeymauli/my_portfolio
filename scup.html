      <h3><b>1. CLIENT BACKGROUND</b></h3>
      <p>Society for College and University Planning, abbreviated SCUP,
        is a non-profit association that helps universities and college
        campuses plan for higher education. As of 2016, SCUP has over 5000
        members across 35 countries. SCUP’s mission is to enable colleges and
        universities plan more effectively and create more success in higher
        education.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h3><b>2. CHALLENGE</b></h3>
      <p>SCUP uses a number of social media platforms to provide content to its
        members and raise awareness about its events and activities.
        Our challenge was to help SCUP develop a social media strategy to drive
        engagement and enable delivery of value to SCUP’s audience.</p>
      </br>
      <h3><b>3. PROCESS</b></h3>
      <h3>3.1 BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>We divided the scope of secondary research amongst us.
        We studied SCUP's background to understand their mission, vision, and business model.
        We evaluated SCUP's exisiting social media content and acitivity.
        We also drew insights from popular blogs and peer-evaluated literature to
        shape our knowledge of social-media usage among non-profits.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h3>3.2 CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</h3>
      <p>We conducted contextual inquiry with six SCUP staff members, including managers and employees,
        who were most able to speak to SCUP’s social media problem.
        Based on initial client meetings and background research, we prepared
        interview protocols about the employees' responsibilities and interactions
        with SCUP’s social media. The interviews took place at SCUP’s office in
        Ann Arbor. For each interview, two members of the team were present,
        one as facilitator and one as notetaker. The interviews averaged about
        one hour in length.

      </br>
      </br>
      <h3>3.3 ANALYSIS & FINDINGS</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We analyzed the interview data by conducting an eight-hour long affinty wall session.
         Our main findings were :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="within-body">
        SCUP was having a problem demonstrating the value of being a member to
        its audiences. This was largely due to a lack of agreement on SCUP’s
        current and desired target populations.
        </li>
        <li class="within-body">
        Social media was being approached as a tool of information broadcast
        and not as a means of social interactions. Too many platforms were being used
        without evaluating the engagement across them.
        </li>
        <li class="within-body">
        Our interviews revealed confusion surrounding job roles and responsibilities with regard to social media.
        The internal team structure of SCUP was undergoing an overhaul, leaving no one specifically tasked with social media.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </br></br>
      <h3><b>4. RECOMMENDATIONS</b></h3>
      <p>We realized that SCUP may face significant turnaround time on execution of all recommendations.
        Bearing this in mind, we organized our recommendations into 2 phases. </p>
      </br>
      <h3>4.1 SHORT TERM SOCIAL MEDIA RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
      <p>
          We recommended turning off all social-media except Twitter until target audience had been identified.
          The secondary research had shown people wanted to engage with other people,
          not organizations. We therefore suggested that employees maintain their own
          accounts with connection to SCUP. Staff members could share issues they were interested in on SCUP’s social media as themselves and not as SCUP.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h3>4.2 LONG TERM SOCIAL MEDIA RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
      <p>
          Multiple interviewees had cited a need for market research. Our primary recommendation
          was determining target social media audience based on market research. We also
          urged the director of SCUP to have one staff member champion social media, instead
          of multiple employees being involved in different phases of the strategy.
